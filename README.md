# In this repository I am attaching my projects that i completed as a part of my internship as a Chatbot developer at Miniworld technologies

# Description: Create a chatbot that can provide users with weather information for a given location.

# Requirements:
      1. The chatbot should be able to understand user queries about the weather, such
      as "What's the weather like in New York today?" or "Will it rain in London
      tomorrow?"
      2. Integrate an API or a weather service to retrieve weather data based on user
      queries.
      3. Parse the user's query to extract the location and date for which the weather
      information is requested.
      4. Display the weather information in a user-friendly format, including details like
      temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy,
      rainy).
      5. Handle cases where the location is not recognized or the weather data is
      unavailable.
      6. Implement error handling and appropriate error messages for any failures or
      unexpected situations.
      7. Test the chatbot with various weather queries to ensure accurate and relevant
      responses.
      8. Optionally, you can incorporate natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
      improve the chatbot's understanding of user queries.
      
# Deliverables:
      1. Weather chatbot source code.
      2. Documentation on how to set up and run the chatbot.
      3. Documentation on the APIs or weather services used, along with any necessary
      credentials or keys.
      4. Testing report with sample user queries and the chatbot's responses.
      Timeline:
      ● Task Definition and Research: 2 days

      ● Development and Integration: 5 days
      ● Testing and Bug Fixes: 3 days
      ● Documentation: 2 days

# More Information To Start

Building a Weather Chatbot without any prior knowledge might be challenging, but I'll
guide you through the general steps involved. Here's a simplified outline to get started:

1. Understand the problem: Familiarize yourself with the concept of a chatbot and
the basics of retrieving weather information through APIs.
2. Research weather APIs: Explore different weather APIs available, such as
OpenWeatherMap, Weather Underground, or AccuWeather. Understand their
documentation, usage limits, and how to fetch weather data using API calls.
3. Learn AIML: AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language) is the markup
language used to create chatbot responses. Familiarize yourself with the AIML
syntax, pattern matching, and template tags.
4. Set up an AIML interpreter: Install an AIML interpreter like Program AB or an AIML
platform like ChatterBot. Follow the instructions provided by the interpreter or
platform for installation and setup.
5. Create AIML patterns and templates: Start creating AIML categories in your AIML
file for different weather-related queries and responses. For example, create a
category with a pattern like "What's the weather like in [location] today?" and a
corresponding template that utilizes the weather API to fetch and display the
weather data.
6. Integrate the weather API: Use the chosen weather API to retrieve weather
information based on the user's location and date. Learn how to make API
requests, handle responses, and extract the relevant data such as temperature,
humidity, and weather conditions.
7. Test and refine: Test your chatbot by inputting sample weather queries and verify
if the chatbot provides accurate and relevant responses. Make adjustments and
improvements as necessary.
8. Enhance the chatbot: Consider adding more features to the chatbot, such as
handling different date formats, multiple locations, or providing extended weather
forecasts. Continuously iterate and refine the chatbot based on user feedback
and real-world usage.

Remember, this is a high-level overview, and you'll need to delve deeper into each step.
Tutorials, documentation, and online resources can provide detailed guidance on each
aspect. Learning and building a chatbot requires time and effort, but it can be an
exciting and rewarding journey. Good luck!
